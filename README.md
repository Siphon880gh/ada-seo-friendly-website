## About
By Weng Fei Fung. The purpose of this website HTML is to demonstrate I can make a website ADA compliant and SEO-friendly so your business can avoid lawsuits and can appear at the top of the Google search results. All div tags are replaced with HTML5 semantic tags, heading tags are used in a hierarchy, all images have Alt tags, Nav elements have role and label attributes, major sections have a tag index that allows users with accessibility needs to jump to consecutive sections, among other features in the code. Feel free to look into the source code or view the demo on a screen reader.
